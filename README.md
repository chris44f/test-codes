## test-codes

Test codes during my early learning of HTML, CSS and JS
My name is Chris, and I'm keen to learn (but im a goofball :@)

### HTML - things I have some knowledge on

see new file 'page.html'
did that open correctly?

### CSS - things I have some knowledge on

zero

#### Challenges

##### Challenge 1

* Go to assets/html folder and recreate this inside `index.html` file inside the `/html` folder
think I've done this now, although havent checked my code on a browser so dont know if issues

##### Feedback

* Never use tables in HTML. certainly not needed here.
why not? whats wrong with tables in html :(
* is this your finished article?
erm well I initially thought your challenge was literally just to create a blank file called index.html which I did, but now I've added code to it (I think) to replicate the .png you uploaded
